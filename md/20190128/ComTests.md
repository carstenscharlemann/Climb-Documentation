## Test Scenario: Communication Tests

### Primary Goal
Verify that implementation of proposed protocol changes in ground-orbit-ground communications do achieve:
1. Improved Uplink/Downlink Speed
2. Improved Communication reliability

### Secondary Goal
* Establish test procedures and hardware setup (Test-Pad?) to get reusable test results.
* Get basic understandig of communications means and Ground station structure (HW and Software).

### Roadmap for Q1-2019

#### 0.1 "Setup test lab"
use existing Pegasus Hardware 1x OBC 1,5(?) x Stacie + Test PC with xUARTS/FTDI.
use existing Pegasus Software to get G-O-G Communication working.

develop test procedures/scripts to easily get hardwrae setup and basic features up and running

#### 0.2 "Define standard test"
develop and run test procedures/scripts to meassure downlink speed.
develop and run test procedures/scripts to meassure uplink speed.
make reference tests for existing PEG HW/SW

#### 0.3 "Make protocol changes"
OBC Software -> faster UART reactions
OBC/Stacie Software -> protocoll adaptions.
